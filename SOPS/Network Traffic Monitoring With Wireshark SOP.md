# Network Traffic Monitoring With Wireshark SOP

## _Author: Osaremeh Abel_

## Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to establish a guide employees can refer to when utilizing WireShark for Network Traffic Monitoring. Wireshark is an open-sourced network protocol analyzer that will capture and analyze the network traffic in real-time on the network. Wireshark is a comprehensive network protocol analyzer, for network analysis and troubleshooting purposes.

## Scope:
This SOP applies to all employees and authorized personnel who
have been granted access to use Wireshark on company-owned
devices or within the company's network environment. Applicable to
all desktops, laptops, mobiles, tablets, AND PCs available in the network.

## Responsibilities:
### **1. IT Department:**
- Administer and manage Wireshark installations.
- Provide training on Wireshark usage and best practices.
- Ensure the availability and integrity of captured data.
- Conduct periodic audits and reviews of Wireshark usage.

### **2. Conditions:**
- Use Wireshark strictly for authorized purposes.
- Adhere to applicable legal and ethical guidelines.
- Safeguard captured data and prevent unauthorized access.
- Report any suspected security incidents or violations.

## Prerequisites:
### **1. Obtaining Proper Authorization:**
- Users must obtain explicit authorization from the IT department
before installing or using Wireshark.
- Unauthorized installation or use of Wireshark is strictly prohibited.
### **2. Use Cases:**
- Wireshark should only be used for legitimate purposes such as
network troubleshooting, performance analysis, and security
investigations.
- Users must not engage in any activities that violate company
policies, laws, or regulations.
### **3. Data Privacy and Security:**
- Users must ensure that any captured data containing sensitive or
confidential information is handled with utmost care and is protected
from unauthorized access.
- Personally identifiable information (PII) or any other sensitive data
must not be captured or stored unless explicitly authorized and
necessary for troubleshooting purposes.
- All captured data must be encrypted during storage and
transmission.
### **4. Non-Intrusive Monitoring:**
- Users must limit their network monitoring to their authorized scope
and refrain from capturing data belonging to other users or unrelated
network segments.
### **5. Lawful Interception:**
- Users must comply with applicable laws and regulations when
intercepting network traffic.
- Lawful interception requests should be handled in accordance with
established procedures and legal requirements.
### **6. Reporting and Incident Handling:**
- Users must report any suspected security incidents or violations
related to Wireshark usage promptly to the IT department.
- Cooperation with incident response teams and providing necessary
information and logs are essential.

## Procedure:
### **1. Launch Wireshark:**
- Open the Wireshark application from the installed location.
### **2. Select Network Interface:**
- From the list of available network interfaces, choose the appropriate
one that you want to capture traffic on.
- Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to capture
traffic on the selected interface.
### **3. Start Capturing Traffic:**
- Click on the "Capture" button to start capturing network traffic.
- Optionally, apply filters to capture specific types of traffic or filter out
unwanted traffic.
### **4. Capture Duration:**
- Determine the appropriate duration for capturing traffic based on the
issue or scenario being investigated.
- Alternatively, set a specific capture file size limit to control the
amount of data captured.
### **5. Reproduce the Issue:**
- Simulate the network issue or perform the actions that trigger the
problem you are investigating.
- Ensure that the issue is captured in the network traffic being
captured by Wireshark.
### **6. Stop Capturing Traffic:**
- Click on the "Stop" button to halt the packet capture process.
- The captured traffic will be displayed in the main Wireshark window.
### **7. Analyze Captured Traffic:**
- Navigate through the captured packets in the packet list pane.
- Expand individual packets to view detailed information and
dissected protocol layers.
- Utilize the various analysis tools and features provided by
Wireshark, such as filters, statistics, and protocol-specific decodes.
### **8. Troubleshooting and Analysis:**
- Identify any anomalies, errors, or patterns in the captured traffic that
may be related to the issue being investigated.
- Use the captured data to diagnose network problems, identify
communication issues, or analyze protocol behaviors.
### **9. Exporting and Sharing Results:**
- If required, export selected packets or the entire capture for further
analysis or sharing with colleagues or support teams.
- Choose appropriate file formats (e.g., PCAP, CSV) for exporting data
based on the intended use.
### **10. Documentation:**
- Document your findings, analysis, and any recommended actions or
solutions based on the Wireshark capture.
[The outline of the activities or sequence of steps for performing the
procedure. This should not be overly detailed -- let it capture the
shape of the activity to be performed, regardless of how the details of
its implementation might change.]
### **11. Post-Capture Actions:**
- Ensure that captured packets containing sensitive or confidential
information are handled according to company policies and privacy
guidelines.
- Securely store or delete captured packet capture files as per the
organization's data retention policies.
### **12. Clean-Up:**
- Close the Wireshark application.
- Properly exit or disconnect from the network interface used for
capturing traffic.
